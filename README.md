# Portfolio-Site
This is my personal portfolio-site, It's the first project for my Grow with Google
Scholarship: Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program - Udacity 2018. It is a pure
front-end project without any javascript included, although the option to use javascript
is open according to the project guidelines at My Udacity Classroom.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need the latest versions of popular web browsers to render the project webpage.
To edit the project you will need a developer's text editor. A version control system to
keep track of your work.

Popular Web Browsers:
```
Google Chrome
Chromium (the open source version of google chrome)
Mozilla Firefox
Apple Safari
Microsoft Internet Explorer
Microsoft Edge
```

Popular Text Editors:
```
Atom
Sublime Text
Brackets
```

Popular version control systems:
```
Git
Mercurial
Bitbucket
```

Or any other browsers/text editors/version control system you are comfortable using.

### Installing

In order to install the project on your system you can either clone the repository
or download a zip file by clicking the green clone or download button located right
above the repository's directories/files listing.

To clone using git navigate to the directory where you'd like to have the project using your terminal/command line app and run the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Patel-Jenu-1991/portfolio-site.git
```

Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

Or you can download the zip file and extract it using your file compression app.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

There are no automated tests as such for this project but to make sure it renders correctly,
you can use developer tools available in your web browsers to inspect individual elements or
its styles.

The other approach you can use is code validation, provided by the W3C.
[W3 CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
[W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

These will report warnings, errors, or bugs in your code if any.

### Coding style tests

The coding style test should be as per the **Project Ruberic** provided in My Udacity Classroom.
[Project Ruberic](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/45/view)

I've used [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) to help me inspect and tidy up my code.

## Deployment

To deploy the portfolio project to a live server you only need to FTP your files
to your web hosting service provider's dashboard.

In order to FTP your files you will either need a FTP client like FileZilla or any other FTP client you are comfortable using.
You can also use your terminal app to deploy your project, google it.

## Built With

* HTML5 - Hypertext Markup Language used to create a basic webpage.
* CSS3 - Cascading Style Sheets used to add glamour to a webpage.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - My favorite text editor (supports git as well plus tons of add-ons/plugins to customize your workflow)

## Contributing

At the moment I have not found anyone to collaborate with on any of my projects, in case you are interested in learning by doing then
why not, let's grow together regardless of being enrolled in the Nanodegree Program. Please contact me by email available on my github profile.
